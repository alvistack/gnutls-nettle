Package: libnettle6
Architecture: amd64
Description: Low level cryptographic library (symmetric and one-way cryptos)
 This package contains the symmetric and one-way cryptographic
 algorithms. To avoid having this package depend on libgmp, the
 asymmetric cryptos reside in a separate library, libhogweed.

Package: libhogweed4
Architecture: amd64
Description: Low level cryptographic library (public-key cryptos)
 This package contains the asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, which,
 require the GNU multiple precision arithmetic library (libgmp) for their
 large integer computations.
